You need to start somewhere.  
  
Our first years learn to make pixel art, to create 2d sprite and skeletal animations, to make 3D models,and to begin learning to code in C#.  
  
Most of all, our students learn to make games, by making games.  
  
```C#
using System;
  
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
